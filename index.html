    <h2><b><u>Shadowing in Javascript!!!</u></b> <br /></h2>
    <h3>
      <br />

      <strong><u>Block Scoping:</u></strong> To understand shadowing in JavaScript, we
      need to be clear with the scope first. In computer programming languages,
      Scope is a certain section/region of the program where a defined variable
      can have its existence and can be recognized, beyond that it can’t be
      accessed. In JavaScript, a Block is a compound statement that is defined
      by curly braces {} and used to combine multiple statements into one
      statement where JavaScript expects only one statement. And all the
      variables and functions that can be accessed inside a block are said to be
      inside that block scope, hence called Block scoped.
      <br />
      <br /><br />
      For example, let and const variables are stored in separate memory space,
      so it is called block-scoped but var variables can be accessed outside the
      block as it is stored in the Global object memory space, hence it is
      called Global scoped.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <b><u>Shadowing:</u></b> Now, when a variable is declared in a certain scope
      having the same name defined on its outer scope and when we call the
      variable from the inner scope, the value assigned to the variable in the
      inner scope is the value that will be stored in the variable in the memory
      space. This is known as Shadowing or Variable Shadowing. In JavaScript,
      the introduction of let and const in ECMAScript 6 along with block scoping
      allows variable shadowing.

      <br /><br /><br />

      1.) By definition, an outer scoped variable is said to be "shadowed" by an
      inner scoped variable when both of them have the same name. To understand
      variable shadowing in JavaScript, you must first be aware of the two
      scopes you can declare variables in:
      <br /><br />

      <b><u>Local Scope:</u></b> Variables declared here are block-scoped or
      function-scoped <br />
      <b><u>Global Scope:</u></b>It's the outermost scope where any variable that's
      declared is available globally. <br />
      <br />

      And, the three ways in which you can declare variables in those two scopes
      are as follows: <br />
      <br />

      => Using 'var' - creates a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable.
      <br />
      => Using 'let' — creates a block-scoped local variable. <br />
      => Using 'const' — creates a block-scoped local constant. <br />
      <br />

      Now that you know the basics, you must remember the following rules that
      apply to variables depending on the scope they're declared in: <br />
      <br />

      =>Variable Type and Scope Determine If the Value of Shadowed Variable Is
      Overwritten. <br />
      =>Local Scope Variables Take Precedence. <br />
      =>let or const Cannot be Shadowed in a Local Scope. <br /><br />

      <b><u>Variable Type and Scope Determine If the Value of Shadowed Variable Is
        Overwritten</u> <br /> </b>
      <br />
      <br />
      1.) Variables declared as let or const are block-scoped and they do not
      overwrite the value of the shadowed variable. <br />
      
      <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
        <u>Example:</u> <br>
            var a = "apple";
            if (true) { 
            // block-scoped (local) 
            let a = "aeroplane"; 
            console.log("inside if block=>", a);<i> // 'aeroplane' </i>
            console.log("outside if block =>", a);<i> // 'apple' <br /></i>
            } <br />
      </pre>


      2.) This isn't true, however, for variables declared with var since they
      are not block-scoped (but rather global and function scoped). Therefore,
      they would overwrite values in block scope but not in function scope. For
      example: <br />
      <br />
      <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
        <u>Example:</u> <br>
            var b = "ball";
            if (true) { 
            // block-scoped (local)
            var b = "bat"; 
            console.log(">>inside if block=>", b);<i> // 'bat' </i>
            console.log("outside if block=>", b);<i> // 'ball' <br /></i>
            } 
      </pre>

      3.) Since variables declared as var are function-scoped, the nested function in the following example won't overwrite the one with the same name in the outer scope:
      <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
        <u>Example:</u> <br>
        function printCat() { 
            var c = "cat"; 
            
            function printCamel() { 
            var c = "camel";
            return c;
            } <br>
            
            console.log(">>inside inner function=>",printCamel()); <i>// 'camel'</i> 
            console.log(">>outside inner function=>",c); <i>//'cat'</i>
            }
      </pre>
      
    <b><u>Local Scope Variables Take Precedence</u></b> <br><br>
      
      
      1.) When you use a local scoped variable of the same name, its value takes precedence over the outer scoped one. For example:

      <pre class="brush: js notranslate">

        {
            // global scope
            var d = 'dog';
            
            if (true) {
                // block-scoped (local)
                const d = 'dice';
                console.log(">>inside if block=>",d);<i> // 'dice'</i>
            }
            
            console.log(">>outside if block=>",d);<i> // 'dog' </i>
        }
      </pre>
      
      
      2.) Same thing happens in a function scope as you can see in the code below:" <br>
      
      <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
        
       { 
            //global scope
            var e = 'entity';
            
            function printE() {
                // function scope (local)
                const foo = 'enemy';
                // ...
                return foo;
            }
            
            console.log(printE());<i> // 'enemy'</i>
            console.log(e);<i> // 'entity'</i>
       }    
      </pre>
      
     <b><u> 'let' or 'const' Cannot be Shadowed in a Local Scope</u></b> <br> <br>
     
     
     1.) In a local scope you cannot shadow another let or const. In that case, you will get an error as shown below:
            
            <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
                function printF() {
                    let f = 'food';
                    
                    if (true) {
                        var f = 'fun';<i> // SyntaxError: Identifier 'f' has already been declared</i>
                        }

                        return f;
                    }
    
            </pre>
        
        However, a variable declared with let, const and var can shadow a global-scoped let, const and var variable. For example:
        
        <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
                // global scope
                const g = 'grape';
                
                if (true) {
                    // block-scoped (local)
                    const g = 'gang';
                    console.log(g);<i> // 'gang'</i>
                }
                
                console.log(g);<i> // 'grape'</i>
        </pre>
        
        
      



      <h2><u><b>DeadZone in Javascript!!!</b></u> <br /></h2>
    
      <p>
        The term <b>"Dead Zone" or "Temperol Dead Zone (TDZ)</b> to describe the
        state where variables are un-reachable. They are in scope, but they
        aren't declared. The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the
        start of their enclosing scope until they are declared (i.e.) the
        variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of
        the block until the initialization has completed. <br /><br />

        <u><b>Note:</b></u> The TDZ happens only with the 'let' and 'const'
        variables because these variables are blocked scoped. For the 'var' the
        variable will be assigned as undefined due to hoisting <br /><br />


        <pre class="brush: js notranslate"> 
            <u>Example:</u> 
            <br />
            {   // TDZ starts at beginning of scope <br />
                console.log(num1); <i>// undefined </i> <br />
                console.log(num1); <i>// ReferenceError </i> <br />
                var bar = 1; <br />
                let foo = 2; // End of TDZ (for foo) <br />
            } <br />
        </pre>


        The term "temporal" is used because the zone
        <b>"depends on the order of execution (time)" rather than the order</b>
        in which the code is written (position). For Example: <br />
        <br />
            <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
            <u>Example:</u> <br>
            {
               <i> // TDZ starts at beginning of scope </i><br />
                const func = () => console.log(letVar); // OK <br /><br />
                
               <i> // Within the TDZ letVar access throws `ReferenceError` </i> <br />        
                let letVar = 3; // End of TDZ (for letVar) <br />
                func(); // Called outside TDZ! <br />
            } 
        
            </pre>
    <br />

        The code above works because, even though the function that uses the let
        variable appears before the variable is declared, the function is called
        outside the TDZ. <br /><br />


        
            <b>The TDZ and typeof</b> <br> <br>
        
        Using the typeof operator for a let variable in its TDZ will throw a <b>ReferenceError</b> <br>
        <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
            <u>Example:</u> <br>
            // results in a 'ReferenceError'

            console.log(typeof i);
            
            let i = 10;
        </pre>

        This differs from using typeof for undeclared variables, and variables that hold a value of undefined.  <br><br>

        <pre class="brush: js notranslate">
            <u>Example:</u> <br>
            // prints out 'undefined' <br>
            console.log(typeof undeclaredVariable);
        </pre>
        
      </p>
